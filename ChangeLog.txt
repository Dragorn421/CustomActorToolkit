## 0.48 ##

- Link and pause menu can now be compiled from a .c file


## 0.46 ##

- Added tool to copy animations from one zobj to another

## 0.45 ##

## 0.42 ##

- Added checkbox to disable warning
- Lowest value of vram is now 80000000
- Object number uncapped
- Fixed an issue where C actors with compile errors were not detected correctly
- Fixed autoupdater

## 0.41 ##

- Autoupdater now uses a different server
- Changed the compiling flags of .C actors

## 0.40 ##

- Added support to actors written in C
- Added credits to z64me and CrookedPoe
- Added button to download z64ovl from repo
- Fixed an issue where actor id was still capped to 0x01D6
- Updated function xml
- "Please wait" message now disappears as it should

## 0.34 ##

- Now allows to enter any actor id instead of being capped to 0x01D6
- CRC calculation is now done by the tool itself to avoid issues with windows rights
- Added an option to convert a file into a mips array
- Clear dma table button now works for all roms, not just debug
- Link can now be decompiled and compiled on all versions, its treated as actor 0 by the tool. Remember to press "Find empty VRAM" button before compiling. Due to certain compilations, the output overlay will always be 0x10 bytes bigger than the original, so find a different rom offset.
- Added an option to convert actors from debug to 1.0. All it does is replacing the documented jal offsets so you still need to do some work.

## 0.33 ##

- Upgraded atom version, includes better padding and different format regarding variables
- Added support to MM U 1.0

## 0.32 ##

- Added Random Drop Table editor, only OOT for now
- Console output is now much more clean, you will only see gcc and novl errors instead of all the .bat commands
- Fixed a crash regarding source files without extension or with non .S extension, gcc will output error with invalid extensions though


## 0.31 ##

- Environment vars are no longer required
- Removed zovldis (no reason to exists since we have Atom)
- MM function XML now contains all undocumented functions used by actors in blank, like the OoT xml
- When compiling, you now get a success message in the console
- Fixed a bug regarding having dots in the directory of the overlay

## 0.30 ##

- ROM data is no longer stored in cache (caused major issues)
- Added a friendly button to automatically set environment vars
- Added a few more OoT jal descriptions
- VRam offset is now labeled as OPTIONAL (pointed by Ideka)
- Added MM J support to both decompile and compile, as well as 21 jal descriptions (afaik this is the only MM version viable due to lack of documentation, don't ask for others)
NOTE: Decompiling actors with MM J takes around 20 sec since it uses the all command instead of the df command

## 0.22 ##
